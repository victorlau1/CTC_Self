/**
 * TripleStack class holds 3 stacks in one array. This is done by interleaving
 * the values from the 3 indexes, so the first items are at 0, 1 and 2 and
 * subsequent items are every 3 places from those. This class takes advantage
 * of the fact that JavaScript arrays are dynamic and doesn't hold the stacks
 * to any size. It doesn't reduce the size of the underlying array when items
 * are popped but that could easily be added.
 *
 * Time: push O(1), pop O(1), peek O(1)
 * Additional space: push O(1), pop O(1), peek O(1)
